# firefox-tabs-pinner

a stupid simple WIP firefox extension to facilitate creating multiple pinned firefox tabs

I constantly have 5 firefox tabs pinned in order: personal calendar, work calendar, email, todoist and linear. Since I don't really like firefox's open last tabs feature and couldn't find an extension that does this for me I decided to make my own.

 This is definitely not production ready. I haven't even published it, I just install manually as a development extension. But it's enough for now.

this is a poorly made clone of an already poorly made extension that you can find [here](https://github.com/brunobmello25/chrome-tabs-pinner)
